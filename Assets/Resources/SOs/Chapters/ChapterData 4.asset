    Entry 4: In the Depths of Darkness

    The caverns grow colder
    and the shadows, longer. I can sense the presence of the Crawler Witch, her malicious
    intent palpable in the air. I must remain vigilant, for her minions lurk in the
    darkness, waiting for an opportune moment to strike. Tonight, I ready my spells
    for tomorrow''s confrontation, knowing that my path to the Crystal Daemon lies
    through her defeat.'
