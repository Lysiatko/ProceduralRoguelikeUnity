    Entry 3: Victory and Descent

    The Ogre King has fallen.
    His minions scattered to the winds, their leader defeated by my arcane prowess.
    Yet, there is no time for rest. The entrance to the cavern lies before me. As
    I delve deeper, a sense of foreboding grips me. I have heard tales of the Crawler
    Witch, a spider-like creature with a venomous mind and a horde of grotesque minions.
    My journey into the cavern begins with caution and determination.'
