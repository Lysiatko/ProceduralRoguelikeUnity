    The battle was grueling, but the
    Crawler Witch is no more. Her minions have retreated into the shadows of the
    cavern. I now stand at the threshold of the Crystal Caverns, the lair of the
    Crystal Daemon. I can feel the pulsating power emanating from within, a siren
    call to the final confrontation. My resolve is unwavering; the daemon and its
    cultists shall fall by my hand.
