    Entry 2: The Ogre King''s Lair

    I now stand at the mouth
    of the Ogre King''s domain. The air is thick with the stench of brimstone and
    the clamor of his minions. My magic will be tested here, and my resolve must
    be unyielding. Tonight, I prepare my spells and steel my mind for tomorrow''s
    battle. I am resolved to defeat the Ogre King and his horde to move forward in
    my quest.
