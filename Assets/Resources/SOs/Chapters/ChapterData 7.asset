  chapterText: 'Entry 7: The Crystal Caverns


    As I step into the Crystal Caverns,
    I am struck by the eerie beauty that surrounds me. The walls glisten with a thousand
    shades, reflecting my torchlight in a kaleidoscope of colors. Yet, this beauty
    masks a deadly danger. The cultists of the Crystal Daemon are unlike any foe
    I have faced; they are zealots, driven by a dark purpose. I can sense their presence
    all around, lurking in the shadows, whispering incantations in a language as
    old as time.
